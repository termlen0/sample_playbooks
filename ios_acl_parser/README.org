* What is this demo addressing

** Use case

   A typical automation use case is to validate whether access-lists are open
   between a given source and destination IP tuple. This demo uses a role to
   solve this. 
   - [X] Checks for subnets
   - [X] Checks for "any"
   - [X] Checks for "tcp" and "udp" being subnets of

* TODO:

  - [ ] Check for variables
  - [ ] Add role dependencies
  - [ ] Ensure module dependency (netaddr) is installed
  - [ ] Add code to validate source port and range of ports
  - [ ] Handle devices that do not have acls configured on them (fail gracefully)
